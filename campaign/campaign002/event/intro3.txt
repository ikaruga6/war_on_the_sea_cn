{"nextAction":"SUMMARY","header":"Battle of Guadalcanal","content":"<size=18><b>7 August 1942</b></size>\nThe primary objective of Operation Mo, the invasion of Port Moresby, was turned away at the Battle of the Coral Sea. Yet the other part of the operation was still undertaken in May where troops successfully occupied the islands of Tulagi and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands.\n\nWith the loss of 4 fleet carriers last month, it is imperative that Japan establishes a large airfield on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands. Once built, this airfield will support further expansion in the South Pacific as well as provide a strong defense for the Empire's southern perimeter.\n\nConstruction of the airfield is about to begin which will no doubt draw the attention of Allied forces in the region. The battle for Guadalcanal is about to begin.","imagePath":"campaign/image/watchtower.jpg"}
