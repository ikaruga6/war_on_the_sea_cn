<b>Tracking Targets</b>
Open Main Guns panel by either <KEY:LeftMouse> on the Main Guns button in the toolbar or use <KEY:Weap0>. Above the deck view of your ship are the two directors, Main and Alt. Directors are observation points which watch and track the current target.

Select target ship
1) Use <KEY:TargetMode> to enter Target Mode (note the mouse pointer change).
2) While in Target Mode <KEY:LeftMouse> on the target ship map icon to set it as your target.

Both directors now have the target listed and the SOL (solution) value is slowly increasing.
In the 3D view the directors on top of the forward and rear tripod masts turn to watch the target.

<KEY:LeftMouse> on Stop for the ALT director to stop tracking the target.

IMPORTANT: Switching to a new target will NOT change a director's target. You must <KEY:LeftMouse> on Stop to cease tracking the current target before assigning a new one.

Re-target the target ship as was done previously. Notice that both ALT and MAIN directors have the same SOL value. This is because they share the observation data.
