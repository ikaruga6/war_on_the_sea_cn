<b>Unit Viewer / Recognition Manual</b>
The Unit Viewer is an encyclopaedia of ships and aircraft. In combat, it is used as a Recognition Manual to classify enemy ships.
<i>In the Battle Editor it is used to add ships and aircraft to an engagement while in a campaign it is used to recruit ships.</i>

Open the Unit Viewer panel by either <KEY:LeftMouse> on the Unit Viewer button in the toolbar or use <KEY:UnitID>. The manual always opens on the page corresponding to the Controlled Unit.

The manual contains information about the various ships and aircraft. Use the icons along the bottom of the panel to examine statistics, weapons, anti-aircraft capabilities and sensors and armour.

Classifying Ships
Correctly classifying the class of an enemy ship provides a bonus to the solution. Use the arrows (<KEY:UnitIDPrev>, <KEY:UnitIDNext>) to cycle through the various ships or the dropdown to select a class directly, then use the checkbox or <KEY:UnitIDClassifyAs> to classify the target as that ship class.
- Requires Controlled Unit to have a target.
- Friendly ships cannot be classified as they are already known.
- Aircraft cannot be classified.

Depending on option settings, targets will automatically be classified when the solution is above a certain value.
