<b>Aircraft</b>
Aircraft can be damaged by machine guns, anti-aircraft fire and flak bursts.
They are destroyed by collisions with ships, sea and terrain.

A close range flak burst is immediately fatal to any aircraft.
Machine guns, anti-aircraft fire and non-fatal flak bursts count as a single hit on aircraft.
Hits have a chance to be absorbed causing no damage.
Chance to absorb a hit is based on aircraft size and whether it has armor or self-sealing fuel tanks.
Each damaging hit produces a smoke trail, with the 3rd damaging hit being fatal to the aircraft.

US heavy bombers have the highest damage absorb chance, allowing them to take a lot of battle damage.
Japanese fighters have none, making them very fragile!

<i>Collisions - aircraft cannot collide with other aircraft.
Friendly fire - aircraft cannot be hit by friendly machine gun fire.</i>
