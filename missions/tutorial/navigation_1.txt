<b>Direct Control</b>
Controlled Unit can be steered directly through key commands.
Wanted speed in knots, rudder or turn setting and altitude/depth (if applicable) are temporarily displayed in the Message Log header (bottom left) whenever changed.




In some cases, navigation input is ignored and the following is displayed:
FORMATION: adjusting speed or height/altitude when unit is already in formation. Applying steering input will break formation.
MANEUVRE: navigation input is blocked during a maneuvre, such as a dive bomber diving or a break turn during a dogfight. 

Tap or hold <KEY:IncreaseSpeed> and <KEY:DecreaseSpeed> to change the speed of your unit.
Tap or hold <KEY:LeftRudder> and <KEY:RightRudder> to turn unit left or right.
Use <KEY:ZeroControls> to set rudder to 0.
Practice changing speed and turning your ship left and right to get a feel for how it handles.

When ready, use next arrow to continue.
