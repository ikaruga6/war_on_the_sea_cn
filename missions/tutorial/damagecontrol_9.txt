<b>Roster Damage Icons</b>
The Roster tab (above the Message Log at bottom left), displays damage status icons for ships.
From left to right;
Fire - at least one compartment is on fire and not under repair.
Flooding - at least one compartment is flooded and not under repair.
Needs Repair - at least one compartment is offline (or not at full integrity) and not under repair.

Compartments may not be under repair due to Auto Assign Damage Control being off, or there are more damaged regions than there are parties to perform the repairs.

These icons are a good indicator that it might be time to take control of that ship and start managing the damage situation.

<i>Fires should always be a priority to extinguish as they cause ongoing damage.</i>

Use <KEY:DamageControl> or the toolbar button to return to Damage Control and attempt to perform all repairs or end this exercise when ready.
<i>As repairs are completed, note improvements to Efficiency and recovery of ship speed once the non-destroyed propellers are back online.</i>
