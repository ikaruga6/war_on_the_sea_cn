<b>Basic Gunnery</b>
Pan camera north to look at target ship (0 on the bearing indicator in top centre of screen).
Use binoculars <KEY:Binoculars> to zoom in (<KEY:MouseWheel> or <KEY:ZoomIn>) on the target ship.

1) Use <KEY:TargetMode> to enter Target Mode (note the mouse pointer change).
2) While in Target Mode <KEY:LeftMouse> on ship to the north set it as your target
(target information appears above Main Toolbar).
3) Use <KEY:Binoculars> to leave Binoculars View.
4) Open Main Guns panel by either <KEY:LeftMouse> on the Main Guns button in the toolbar or use <KEY:Weap0>.
5) Press FIRE to begin firing on the target ship.

<i>Note: <KEY:LeftMouse> a ship while not in Target Mode moves camera to that ship. If this occurs, simply <KEY:LeftMouse> on Porter again.
<KEY:LeftMouse> on a map icon is equivalent to <KEY:LeftMouse> on a ship in the 3D world.
Remember: Ship currently under your control is displayed above the Main Toolbar.</i>

Experiment with the CEASE (guns return to rest position), HOLD (guns continue to aim, but stop firing) and FIRE buttons.
Use HOLD to point all guns at target, wait several seconds then use FIRE to fire all guns at once (salvo mode).
When ready, use next arrow to continue.
