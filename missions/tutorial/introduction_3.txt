<b>Fire At Will</b>
At the top of the Main Guns panel is the button "AT WILL". <KEY:LeftMouse> this to begin firing guns at will.
Porter immediately targets the closest oiler and begins firing at will.

Fire At Will mode will do the following;
- commence firing primary (and secondary) guns at detected or upon detecting enemy units
- assign target of primary guns to all directors
- switch to new target if current target sunk or no longer detected
- automatically use HE rounds against destroyers, submarines, merchants, oilers
- adjusts spread based on target solution
- fires star shells (in dark conditions) to illuminate the target
- hides FIRING ORDERS settings on gun panels replacing them with "FIRING AT WILL"

<KEY:LeftMouse> "Stop" below FIRING AT WILL to return to manual gunnery.
Note Porter will continue to fire at its current target (but no longer automatically manages ammuntion type or other settings).
<KEY:LeftMouse> CEASE to stop firing.

Fire At Will mode is on by default in regular battles and is useful to automate the gunnery of multiple ship under your control.
