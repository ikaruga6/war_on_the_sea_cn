<b>Taking Over Locations: Bombard</b>
A small Japanese landing force has taken over RENNELL ISLAND and built a Rank 2 airfield there.

The strategy to take back RENNELL ISLAND will be:
1) Bombard the location with TASK FORCE 1 in an attempt to knock out the airfield (at night to avoid aircraft).
2) Send in TROOP convoy to land troops and supplies.
3) Once enemy troops are subdued, send in CONSTRUCTION convoy to rebuild the airfield.

Bombard Location
- Select "TASK FORCE 1" by <KEY:LeftMouse> on the friendly battleship icon near RENNELL ISLAND or use Next Sea/Air (<KEY:NextMobile>) button in toolbar to cycle though your groups to it.
- Select "Shore Bombardment" from the lower orders dropdown and <KEY:LeftMouse> corresponding execute button (             ) to bombard this location.
- <KEY:LeftMouse> the corresponding execute button 2 more times to perform a total of 3 bombards.
Note the message confirming the bombards above the toolbar.
Remember that a bombard action expends 1/3 ammunition and requires heavy cruisers or larger to perform.

With the bombardment complete, <KEY:LeftMouse> COURSE and plot a course for TASK FORCE 1 back to NEW HEBRIDES to withdraw it from the area.
