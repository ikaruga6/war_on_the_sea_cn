<b>Orders Panel</b>
Use <KEY:Orders> or the toolbar button to open the Orders panel.
The left section of this panel and contains alternate slider controls for, speed, steering and altitude/depth (when applicable).

Use sliders to adjust the speed and steering of your destroyer.
Use <KEY:IncreaseSpeed>, <KEY:DecreaseSpeed>, <KEY:LeftRudder>, <KEY:RightRudder> and <KEY:ZeroControls> to also adjust speed and steering and note the sliders update.

Ships have inertia and require some time to react to speed and course changes. Larger ships take longer to respond.

Turning "bleeds" speed. This is most noticeable at high speeds and when performing a maximum turn which may bleed up to ~40% of speed.

When ready, set speed to 15 and rudder to  <--  to keep your destroyer sailing in a circle, then use next arrow to continue.
