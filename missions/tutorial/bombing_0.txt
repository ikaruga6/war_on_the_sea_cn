<b>Attacking Manually</b>
In the previous exercise we examined attacking ships automatically with single aircraft or multiple aircraft using either;
1) Formation attack by issuing an attack order to the flight leader only
2) Independent attack by issuing an attack order to all aircraft in the flight

Today we will perform fully manual attacks against shipping.

Take control of "1. B17-F", target either of the ships and gently steer the formation leader towards the target.
<i>Once a target is specified, note the bombsight and intercept markers on the mini map.
They are available for any aircraft with bombs or aerial depth charges and indicate when to drop the payload when level bombing.</i>

While approaching the target ship:
1) <KEY:LeftMouse> the red tab to select all B17s in the group.
2) <KEY:LeftMouse> the Bomb Doors toolbar button or <KEY:Weap5> to open the bomb doors of all selected aircraft.
3) With gentle turns, steer formation so that bombsight marker will overlap the target's intercept maker.
4) A few seconds before it overlaps, <KEY:LeftMouse> the All Drop toolbar button or <KEY:Weap6> for all selected aircraft to drop their payload.
5) Once all bombs are dropped, close the bomb doors and watch the target ship to see if they scored a hit.
<i>Note: unlike the other toolbar buttons, Bomb Doors <KEY:Weap5> and All Drop <KEY:Weap6> commands are always carried out by all selected aircraft.</i>
