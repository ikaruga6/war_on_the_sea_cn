<b>Air Formations</b>
A flight of 3 Wildcats are in the area, so we can switch to them next.

Switch control to a Wildcat.
[Hint] Zoom the map out until you can see the aircraft. Be sure not to be in Target Mode <KEY:TargetMode>, Navigation Mode <KEY:NavigationMode> or Selection Mode <KEY:SelectMode>, then <KEY:LeftMouse> on the aircraft icon to take direct control.

Alternatively; Use the Switch Sea/Air toggle below the roster list to switch between the Air or Sea roster. Then <KEY:LeftMouse> on the small arrow icon of 1. Wildcat to go to that unit and assume direct control of it.

Setting air formations and selecting air units works exactly as it did for Sea formations.
Practice adjusting the air formation and spacing (you may want to look back over the last 3 pages).

When finished, put the aircraft into Vic formation with 50 yd spacing with 1. Wildcat as the lead.
Hint: <KEY:LeftMouse> 1. Wildcat icon on map, <KEY:LeftMouse> tabs of 2. Wildcat & 3. Wildcat in the air roster to select them, then set dropdown to Vic, slider to 50 and <KEY:LeftMouse> Form Up button.
