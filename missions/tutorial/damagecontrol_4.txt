<b>Icons</b>

Icons on the Hull & Deck Views indicate the status of a compartment or subsystem:


					Flooded - Hull only. The compartment is flooded or taking on water. Too many flooded compartments will cause a ship to
					sink or capsize.

					Burning - The compartment or subsystem is on fire. Burning causes damage over time and fires may spread to
					neighbouring areas (including from hull to deck and deck to hull).

					Repairing - A damage control party is in the compartment or subsystem and is repairing it.
