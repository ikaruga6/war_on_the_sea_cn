<b>Attacks With Multiple Aircraft: Formation</b>
Attacking with multiple aircraft can be done in 2 ways, as a formation or independently.

Formation Attack
Select ONLY the leader of a flight and order it to attack a target.
Aircraft following this leader will hold formation and attack the target when the leader does.








Used for aerial torpedo and bombing attacks where dropping ordnance in a pattern or spread is desired.
Pattern and spread is based on formation and spacing of the flight. Modify this prior to ordering the attack.

<i>Effective only when the flight is already in formation or will have sufficient time to reform before reaching the target.</i>
