<b>Compartments and Subsystems</b>
Mouse over a compartment or region to display additional information:

The name of the compartment or region.
Repair time and an icon to indicate if a damage control party is present.

Integrity - status icons (fire, flooded, offline or damaged) and the current percent intact.
Armor - thickness of vertical (belt) and horizontal (deck) armor.
Torpedo Defense - how well a hull compartment can resist a hit from a torpedo.
Ammunition - if a weapon system or magazine.

Torpedo Defence Systems
Some ships have a Torpedo Defense System (TDS) built into their hull. It is expressed as a percentage.
Upon a torpedo hit to a compartment with a TDS:
- chance for torpedo damage to be dealt to neighbouring compartments is reduced by half of the TDS value.
- all damage dealt by the torpedo is reduced by the TDS value.
- TDS value of compartment hit and its neighbours reduced to 0% as they are permanently destroyed by the torpedo impact.
