<b>Recruiting Ships 2</b>
Enterprise will need an escort, so let's add an Atlanta class cruiser and a Tambor class submarine;
- Select an Atlanta class cruiser from the Unit Viewer and use Add Unit (<KEY:UnitIDClassifyAs>) to add it to the Sea group.
- Finally select any Tambor class submarine from the Unit Viewer and use Add Unit (<KEY:UnitIDClassifyAs>) to add it to the Sea group.

Adding Tambor was not a good idea! The submarine is slow and decreases the speed of the task force.
Remove Tambor from the group by <KEY:LeftMouse> on the Tambor icon within the group to select it, then <KEY:LeftMouse> REMOVE.

Change Formation
<KEY:LeftMouse> the formation icon to preview the current group formation.
Note that Enterprise is ahead of Atlanta in Line Ahead formation.
<KEY:LeftMouse> Enterprise and Atlanta icons within the group to select them and <KEY:LeftMouse> SWAP to switch their positions.
Atlanta is now in the lead.

<KEY:LeftMouse> DONE to pay the COMMAND POINT cost and recruit the ships.
The newly created task force is automatically selected and the group manager panel opens.
