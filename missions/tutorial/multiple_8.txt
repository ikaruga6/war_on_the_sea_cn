<b>Controlling Formations In Combat</b>
Take control of the lead Wildcat. The other 2 Wildcats, should be flying in formation with it. Gently steer left and right and note the other aircraft holding formation.

For both Air and Sea units:
- When leading formations it is best to perform gentle turns only and keeping speed at about 75% will allow any stragglers to catch up.
- Applying any steering input or using the BREAK button under Orders panel will cause the Controlled Unit to immediately leave any formation it is in.

Experiment with changing the formation type while in combat (leave spacing at 50 yd to keep the aircraft close to each other).

Switch to the destroyers and Experiment with sailing in formation and changing the formation type (leave spacing at 500 yd to keep the ships close to each other).
