<b>Skip Bombing</b>
Skip bombing involves dropping bombs at very low altitude so that they skip like a stone across the water to their target.

Take control of the aircraft "4. Dauntless" (Dive Bomber) which is to the north and already at low altitude.
Altitude can be set manually using <KEY:MoveDown>, <KEY:MoveUp> or use the altitude slider on the Orders panel.

Staying around 150 ft altitude, target one of the ships and fly straight towards it.
<i>Using Chase Camera or Look At Target may help with lining up the attack.</i>

At low altitude and about 750-1000 yd from target, use <KEY:Weap1> to drop bombs.
They should strike the water, skip towards the target and may fall short, bounce over or hopefully strike the target.

It takes practice and some luck to consistently score hits with this technique.
However it does involve flying straight and low at enemy ships, exposing the attacker to anti-aircraft fire.
