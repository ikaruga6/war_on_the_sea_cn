<b>Solution Modifiers</b>
The following increase the solution:																		The following decrease the solution:
- Good visibility to target, at close range																- Poor visibility to target, at long range
- Using Spotting fire against the target																- Changes in target course or speed
- Correct identification of target ship class															- Changes in observing ship's course or speed
- Using radar																											- Losing contact with target
- Target using radar																								- Target burning or releasing smoke
- Darkness and target illuminated by fire, muzzle flashes or fire						  (unless observer using radar)

To demonstrate this;
1) Use <KEY:TargetMode> to enter Target Mode (note the mouse pointer change).
2) While in Target Mode <KEY:LeftMouse> on Porter map icon to set it as your target.
3) Wait for the solution to reach 90+%.

Upon opening the next tutorial page, Porter will speed up and begin turning.
Watch the solution values along with target speed and heading displayed above the Main Toolbar.

As Porter speeds up and turns the solution value will decrease. It is much harder to predict where a manoeuvring ship will be.
