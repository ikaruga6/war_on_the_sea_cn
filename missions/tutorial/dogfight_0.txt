<b>Dogfights</b>
In the previous lesson we examined air attacks on shipping. Today we will cover shooting down other aircraft in dogfights. You have been assigned 2 Wildcats for this mission.

Select your wingman by SHIFT + <KEY:LeftMouse> and drag on map or <KEY:LeftMouse> the colored group tab, its Roster tab, or entering selection mode and <KEY:LeftMouse> on its map icon.

A flight of 3 simulated Zeros are in the area flying in a large circle. They will not attack.
Wait for a moment for one of your pilots to spot them.

Once spotted:
Use <KEY:TargetNearestAir> to target closest enemy aircraft.
Use <KEY:AttackTarget> for all selected aircraft to being attacking, note they leave their group and attack independently.
Use <KEY:FollowCam> to watch the action unfold.

At any time, use <KEY:TargetNearestAir> to target nearest enemy aircraft then <KEY:AttackTarget> to reprioritise attacking closest target.
As soon as a target is shot down, another enemy aircraft will automatically be engaged.
