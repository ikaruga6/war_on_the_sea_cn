<b>Status: Efficiency and Vulnerable</b>
Efficiency
Impacts repair/reload times and solution calculations.
Decreased by 1% for each offline, flooded or burning compartment.
Decreased by 15% if the command centre is offline or destroyed, namely the Bridge
or Control Room for submarines.


Vulnerable
A penalty applied to time to extinguishing fires and increases fire spread chance.
- Carrier performing Air Operations: 60%
- Cargo on board: Troops (20%), Supplies (30%), Engineering (40%), Fuel (80%)
<i>During a Dynamic Campaign, a carrier on cooldown after launching or landing aircraft
is considered to be performing Air Operations.</i>

If present, the vulnerable penalty is displayed at bottom of Status section.
In the example shown here, an oiler carrying fuel requires 180% the time to extinguish fires and fires have a 180% chance to spread.
When present, mouse over the Vulnerable text to display the cause of the penalty, in this example it would display "Fuel".
