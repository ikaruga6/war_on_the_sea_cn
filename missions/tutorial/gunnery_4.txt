<b>Firing Orders 2</b>
LOOSE / FULL / NARROW
Adjusts fall of shot pattern to be more spread out (LOOSE), or tighter (NARROW).
LOOSE: best used against a target with a poor firing solution, one that is manoeuvring or if you need a lucky hit quickly.
NARROW: best used against a target with an excellent solution or that is stationary. FULL is the default spread.

Shell Type AP / HE / SS
AP: armor piercing, best used against heavily armoured ships.
Although AP shells can punch through armor and explode within the target they have a smaller warhead.
HE: high explosive, best used against "soft" unarmoured targets or to knock out subsystems such as directors and funnels.
Explode on impact with a larger warhead, but cannot penetrate thicker armor.
SS: star shell, an illumination round that drops a flare above the target position. Only 1 star shell per turret is fired.
Illuminated targets are easier to see in dark conditions, giving a bonus to the solution calculation against them.
