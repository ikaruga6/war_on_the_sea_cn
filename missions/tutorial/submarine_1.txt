<b>Torpedo Attack</b>
While submerged, the Binoculars view cannot be used unless:
- submarine is at or above periscope depth
- periscope is raised and functional

<KEY:LeftMouse> Scope button to raise the periscope and use <KEY:Binoculars> or Binoculars button on Secondary Toolbar to enter periscope view.

Target the old oiler nearby to the west (90 on the camera bearing indicator) by entering Target Mode (<KEY:TargetMode>) and <KEY:LeftMouse> on the freighter (or its map icon).

Use <KEY:Weap3> to open the torpedo weapon panel.
<KEY:LeftMouse> the rear torpedo room icon to deselect it so as to only fire the forward torpedo tubes.
Set both sliders under SETTINGS to 3 in order to fire 3x torpedoes with a 3° spread.
<KEY:LeftMouse> FIRE to fire the torpedoes.

Use <KEY:Binoculars> or Binoculars button on Secondary Toolbar to leave periscope view and watch the torpedo attack.
<i>Note that torpedoes fired from submarines run a few hundred yards, arm their warhead, then turn using a gyro to their final destination. Torpedo attacks with a low gyro angle off the bow or stern are the most accurate.</i>
