<b>Recruiting Ships</b>
<KEY:LeftMouse> NEW SEA button below the port icon of NEW HEBRIDES.
A new panel opens where you may build a new Sea group, along with the Unit Viewer to select individual ships.

Use the Unit Viewer to select YORKTOWN class carrier.
Use the Names in Class dropdown to select Enterprise then use Add Unit (<KEY:UnitIDClassifyAs>) to add Enterprise to the Sea group.
Enterprise appears in the group along with the total point cost required to recruit the group.

When selecting individual ship names in the Unit Viewer, some may not be available based on the prefix in front of their name:
(C) - Command. This ship is already under your command.
(U) - Unavailable. This ship is not available in the campaign. It is already sunk or not in service at the time.
(S) - Sunk. This ship has been sunk during the course of the campaign.
(R8) - Repair. This ship is under repair and will be available to recruit in the number of days indicated, in this example 8.

Yorktown is listed as "(U) Yorktown" as this ship was lost at the Battle of Midway and is not available for this campaign.
