Sensors & Detection
Time of day, weather and sea state dramatically impact visual, radar and sonar detection ranges. As a very rough guide;
Ships detect other ships visually at a range equal to: sum of the ships visual horizons * lowest visual detection value * visibility.
You may have to experiment with initial detection ranges when switching from daylight and good weather to night and/or bad weather.

Performance
The total number of aircraft and ships in a battle is currently unlimited, however for best game performance it is not recommended to exceed 20 ships and 20 aircraft in a single battle.
