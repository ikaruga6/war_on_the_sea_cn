<b>Attacks With Multiple Aircraft: Independent</b>
Independent Attack
Select ALL members of the flight and order them to attack a target.
Aircraft will break formation, act individually, converge on the target and attack at will.








Used for dogfights, strafing and rocket attacks or against stationary targets where spreading out the attack is not necessary.
Be careful not to bunch up a formation making it susceptible to anti-aircraft fire or enemy fighters!

<i>Effective when the flight is already in formation or if scattered.</i>
<i>Best used with loose or spaced out formations so as not to bunch up your aircraft.</i>
