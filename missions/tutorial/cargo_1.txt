<b>Taking Over Locations: Loading Cargo</b>
A convoy named "TROOP" is already at port in NEW HEBRIDES.
Another convoy, "CONSTRUCTION" is nearby to the east to be used later in this tutorial.

Select "TROOP" by <KEY:LeftMouse> on the convoy icon  or use Next Sea/Air (<KEY:NextMobile>) button in toolbar to cycle though your groups to it.
On the group manager panel, use the lower orders dropdown to select Manage Cargo, then <KEY:LeftMouse> the corresponding execute button to open the Cargo panel. <i><KEY:LeftMouse> this panel and drag to reveal the Cargo panel if needed.</i>

The Cargo panel shows the location on the left, along with available resources there.
If no location is within 15NM, no location data is shown and cargo cannot be transferred.
To the right is the cargo on board a particular ship, only one type of cargo may be loaded onto a ship at a time.

Load Troops onto the Type C3 ship by <KEY:LeftMouse> of the Arrow button in the Troops row, then use arrow buttons at top to cycle to the next ship. Repeat for the second Type C3 ship so that 2 in total are loaded with troops.
Then load Supplies onto the other 2 Type C3 ships by <KEY:LeftMouse> of the Arrow button in the Supplies row for each of them respectively.

Transfer of cargo is instantaneous, there is no time penalty for changing your mind and switching cargo back and forth.
Once done, 2 ships should be loaded with troops and 2 ships with supplies. When finished, close the Cargo panel.
