<b>Torpedo Attack 2</b>
Mouse over a torpedo room icon to display additional information:
- Firing arc
- Target position
- Number of tubes loaded
- Number of torpedo reloads available

<i>Torpedo rooms can only fire up to the number of loaded tubes (irrespective of settings slider value).
Torpedoes are reloaded one at a time per torpedo room.</i>

Unlike warships which use directors to track targets, a submarine uses the control room. If knocked out or destroyed, targets cannot be tracked to build better firing solutions.
