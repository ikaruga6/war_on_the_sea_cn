<b>Compartment Colors</b>

The color in which a compartment is highlighted indicates:

					Damaged* - Maximum integrity has been reduced, cannot be repaired any higher.

					Can Repair - Integrity is below maximum and can be repaired.

					Offline - The subsystem here is no longer working until repaired.

					Destroyed - Integrity has been reduced to 0. Any subsystem here is permanently offline. If within the hull
					it is automatically flooded. Destroyed compartments cannot be repaired but damage control can be assigned to fight fires.
					<i>Dynamic Campaigns: can only be restored by releasing the ship from your command. Damaged ship enters repair queue
					and becomes available to recruit (fully restored) once repair time is completed.</i>

* Once damaged, a compartment cannot be fully repaired back to 100 integrity. Only part (50%) of the damage is restored resulting in permanent loss of maximum integrity.
Such Damaged compartments can only be fully restored by releasing a ship at a friendly port for Rest & Repair during a campaign.
