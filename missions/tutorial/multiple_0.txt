<b>Briefing</b>
<i>Do not use START button in upper centre to begin combat until instructed to do so.</i>
This screen is the pre-combat briefing. It is the full screen tactical map but time is PAUSED, in order to place units, set their formation and issue some initial basic orders prior to combat starting.
- All tutorials, except this one, bypass the briefing for convenience but for all other battles and campaign engagements it is presented.
- Commands issued while in the briefing are carried out immediately, such as changing formations and placement of units.
- Menu panel outlines environmental conditions for the upcoming battle.
