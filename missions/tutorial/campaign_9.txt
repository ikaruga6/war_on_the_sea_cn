<b>Land Based Aircraft</b>
Launching aircraft from airfields is essentially the same as from ships.
Select a friendly location with an airfield by <KEY:LeftMouse> on the location icon or use Next Location (<KEY:NextLocation>) button in toolbar to cycle through locations. NEW HEBRIDES or PORT MORESBY are good choices for this tutorial.

Under the airfield icon, <KEY:LeftMouse> NEW AIR to open the create air group panel.
As before, you may select the aircraft type, number, payload and then <KEY:LeftMouse> DONE to launch the flight.
A cooldown after launching or landing planes is required before additional planes can be launched from an airfield (or ship).
Plot a course for this new flight as was done for the Dauntless flight earlier.

<KEY:LeftMouse> Time Max (<KEY:TimeMax>) to maximise time compression and watch the flight move across the map.
As soon as the flights Endurance reaches 0, it will automatically return and land at its Home.
Once Endurance reaches 0, a new course can no longer be plotted.
Notice that the other aircraft flight and Sea group begin following the course plotted earlier in this tutorial.
<KEY:LeftMouse> Pause (<KEY:TimePause>) once all aircraft return and have landed.
