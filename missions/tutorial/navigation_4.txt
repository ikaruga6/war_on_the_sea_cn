<b>Switching Between Sea & Air units</b>
A Wildcat from the USS Enterprise is in the area, so we can switch to it and practice controlling aircraft.

Zoom the map out until you can see both the aircraft and USS Porter. Be sure not to be in Target Mode <KEY:TargetMode> or Navigation Mode <KEY:NavigationMode>, then <KEY:LeftMouse> on aircraft icon to immediately switch the camera to it and assume direct control. You may also <KEY:LeftMouse> directly on units in the 3D view for the same effect.

<i>Note that <KEY:LeftMouse> on an enemy unit will move the camera to it, but maintain the original Controlled Unit. </i>

Alternatively;
1) Use Switch Sea/Air toggle icon at bottom left to switch between Air or Sea units.
2) <KEY:LeftMouse> on the small arrow icon to go to that unit and assume direct control of it.
