<b>Follow Target</b>
Select Clark as the Controlled Unit.
Target Moffett. (Use <KEY:TargetMode> to enter Target Mode then <KEY:LeftMouse> Moffett map icon.
<KEY:LeftMouse> Follow Target.
Clark is now in position behind Moffett and will follow Moffett wherever it goes.

You can get creative with using formations and follow target to swap your units about and place them in the desired positions prior to combat beginning.
<i>Ordering multiple units to Follow the same unit will result in the units following each other as per a Line Ahead formation.</i>

When finished, put the ships into Line Abreast with 500 yd spacing with Porter as the lead ship.
Hint: <KEY:LeftMouse> Porter icon on map, <KEY:LeftMouse> Clark and Moffett names in the ship roster, set dropdown to Line Abreast, slider to 500, then <KEY:LeftMouse> Form Up button.
