<b>Damage Control Parties</b>
A ship will have one or more damage control parties as shown under Status.

Assigning a damage control party to a compartment or region of a ship will in the following order;
1) If burning: Extinguish fire after timer expires
2) If flooded: Remove flooding after timer expires
3) If offline: Restore subsystem after timer expires
4) If damaged: Restore integrity to 100%
5) Party automatically returned to available list
Assuming a 2 minute timer for fire, flooding and repairs: a damaged, burning, flooded region with the subsystem offline would take 8 minutes to restore. If that region takes additional damage (not from burning) or party is manually reassigned elsewhere, timer for that step is restarted.

A party decreases the chance of fire or flooding to spread into their region by 50%.
<i>Remember that a party can only fight fires in a destroyed region, it cannot be repaired, it is permanently offline and if within the hull, counts as permanently flooded.</i>

On clicking next, an explosion and fires at the rear of the ship will be simulated.
