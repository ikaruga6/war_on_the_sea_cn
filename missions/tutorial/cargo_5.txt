<b>Encounters & Attacking Enemy Units (disabled during tutorial)</b>
When units of opposing sides detect each other (or are very close) an encounter occurs.
Example to right shows a friendly Wildcat group detecting a Japanese convoy.
Time is paused and campaign cannot continue until an encounter is resolved.
	BEGIN - Enter the 3D world and play out the battle.
	IGNORE - Air units may ignore Sea units and simply report their position and leave.
	SAVE - Save the campaign prior to starting the engagement.
	GO TO - Select the friendly group involved and zoom map to position of engagement.

After a battle, contact is lost for a grace period of 60 minutes.
The enemy may leave the area or remain and continue searching for your forces to re-engage.
All ammunition expended as well as destroyed regions of Sea units persist until rearmed or repaired.
Sunk or scuttled Sea units are permanently lost by both sides.

If not engaged in battle, hostile contacts remain visible on the map for several hours, fading over time.

IMPORTANT: Using TACTICAL button on a friendly Sea or Air group will place nearby enemy units
(detected or not) into the world, allowing them to be attacked.
